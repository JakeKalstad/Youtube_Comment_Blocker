Youtube_Comment_Blocker
=======================

A chrome extension to add a list of keywords to detect in youtube comments and remove them accordingly. 

Inspired by r/videos youtube collection having the same 4 troll comments on every video that have survived well past there novelty.

In the process it became apparent that a list of user-defined key words to scan and remove eye soars would be a pretty wonderful
tool in combatting the atrocious comments in youtube.

So far this list is great. 

Reddit, reddit, Reddits, reddits, religion, Religion, god, God, Atheism, atheism, obama, Obama, obummer, Obummer, illuminati, Narwhal
